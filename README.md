TextAdventure-Base
==================

An example that offers ideas on how to get started with a JavaScript-based HTML5 text adventure game.
Working title for your game:

Describe the opening of the game. This should include what choices are available to the user at the start of the game (e.g., the "character creation" phase) and what backstory or setup is presented: 
  My game will open by introducing the player to the game with the instructions; what keys do what and how to quit the game. My   game could be a player moving around a large house and finding various objects that are asked of them, they could guess what   room things are in and gain points in that way

Describe the setting/world for your game. What kind of environment and locations will the player be in and move through?: 
  The setting will be a large house and the characters can be either a boy or girl and will have preset names that they can       choose from.


List the entities in the game. These are the people, monsters, objects, etc. that appear in the game. If possible, mention the locations where these entities might be found, and perhaps some additional information regarding how these entities relate to the story and gameplay.:
  There will be the people and various animals that you would normally not find in a house; dogs, snakes, birds, lions, etc. Some will possibly pop out throughout the halls and rooms. They could also have trap doors that they fall in if possible.


List the various actions that a user will be able to take in your game. Not every action must be available at all times in the game - for example, if there is nothing to pick up in a particular room, then the "pickup" or "take" action might not be available.:
  The user will be able to manuver throughout the house using words or possibly pick the room to go to next.


Describe the endgame scenarios. How, where, and when can the game end? Not every decision is a game-ending decision, and not every location or entity directly relates to the ending of the game... but which are?:
  The game will end if the player find a specific object in a room with enough lives remaining.
